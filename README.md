# Subway Navigation
[![Codacy Badge](https://api.codacy.com/project/badge/Grade/8dd45c79552648af851deefc0a2dc502)](https://www.codacy.com/app/daryanekryach/SubwayNavigation?utm_source=github.com&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_content=daryanekryach/SubwayNavigation&amp;utm_campaign=Badge_Grade)

WPF project for displaying navigation between two Kiev subway stations. In this project I used Breadth-First Search for finding the path between two stations and XML for storing data about them.

To make things look more beautiful and interesting there's an animation for showing the path between two points :)
